# Player's Desk APP

## Introduction

Welcome to Player's Desk, your ultimate tool for organizing and enhancing your tabletop role-playing game (RPG) experiences. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or just starting your journey into the world of Dungeons & Dragons, Player's Desk is designed with you in mind. This web system is developed with the dual purpose of assisting me in managing my campaigns as a player and providing a platform to continually study React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Features

### Campaign Organization

- **Character Sheets**: Create and manage detailed character sheets for your RPG personas, keeping all your character information in one place.
- **Notes and Journals**: Maintain campaign notes, personal journals, and adventure logs for each of your characters to document your epic tales and discoveries.
- **File Upload**: Easily upload and store related files, including character art, maps, and handouts, to enrich your gaming experience.
- **Campaign Dashboard**: Get an overview of all your ongoing campaigns and characters on a dedicated dashboard.

### D&D Resources

- **Rules and Information**: Access a vast library of D&D rules, spells, classes, items, and more to aid in character creation and world-building.

## React Learning

- **Hands-on Practice**: Player's Desk serves as a practical playground for me to improve my React skills. It's a way for me to dive into the code, experiment with components, and understand how modern web applications work.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
